 In  the  first  at  once  it would be desirable to dispel a certain myth about
 death  OpenVMS.  OpenVMS prospers and till today, having taken itself not only
 ancient  vax,  but  also  modern  alpha on what it is possible to congratulate
 compaq. 7.3 version it is supported rather zealously, and the quantity docs on
 her  (and  not  only)  constantly  grows. Literally half-year back compaq have
 given out to the public 'OpenVMS Guide to System Security'. Basically there is
 that to esteem :)
 
 The first VMS were issued for vax processors and already aimed on cluster work
 (!).  Everyone  cluster  was  a  local  net which incorporated with each other
 forming  decnet. Most oldest comrades remember clearly 80th and 90th years and
 rough burst of interest to this network. It is enough to get on anyone OpenVMS
 to type 'show net' and to climb further and further. I want to assure - decnet
 exists  and  breathes  a  full  breast  and on now, and people which him use -
 thousand  (if not millions). Addressing in him rather simple: x.y, where 'x' -
 number  of  area, and 'y' - node number in this area. To connect with new host
 outside  of  cluster, it is necessary full node number in decnet it host which
 is  considered  simply: y (x * 1024). And further 'set host <that_have_result>
 and  have  gone.  Or  if to swarm up cluster it is simple 'show cluster', 'set
 host <name>'.

 To  use decnet it is possible basically and nothing knowing, but OpenVMS it is
 interesting not only to them. In particular she has 2 different assemblers for
 2å  different platforms, command line language (dcl) which is rather original,
 the  pascal,  basic, C the compiler, the original organization of file systems
 (ods-1,2,5).  Naturally  the  structure  *.exe files (which 4 kinds) for these
 file systems and etc,etc.


 Initially  file  system  was  named files-11 on-disk structure (ODS). The word
 files-11 in people (as usually it happens) was cast away by itself, and now we
 speak simply ODS:

 ODS-1 - the most ancient. Only for vax. Length of names of files of 9 bytes.
 ODS-2 - especially distributed. Both for vax and for alpha. It is long a name
         of a file 40.
 ODS-5 - New file-system beginning from OpenVMS 7.2. Completely works only for
         alpha. It is possible to mount and on vax, but features ods5 at the 
         order will not be.


 As  ODS-2  till  now  remains to the most widespread, her briefly and we shall
 consider. The file-system uses some control files settling down in master file
 directory:

 indexf.sys;1 - rather global file. Contains the information on an axis on the 
                given volume and the information on given all files on him. Has
                the rather interesting structure about which it is better to  
                esteem in 'guide, to openvms file applications'.
 bitmap.sys;1 - roughly speaking the information on the accessible place/size.
 badblk.sys;1 - the list of bad-blocks.
 000000.dir;1 - a root directory.
 corimg.sys;1 - core image file. it is not supported by an OS.
 volset.sys;1 - contains the list of all volumes.
 contin.sys;1 - identification of files at 'cross' with one partsh. on another.
 backup.sys;1 - reserved for future use.
 badlog.sys;1 - contains the list of blocks suspected as bad-blocks.
 security.sys;1 - contains volume security profile, also is used by set/show 
                  security commmands.


 Root  directory  is  000000.  i.e.  $  cd aga$dra0: [000000]. In general it is
 especially  useful  to  make 'show logical' - will be a lot of interesting. In
 the  best way, besides to esteem 'guide to openvms file application' since all
 in article to not find room. It is possible to add still, that all is measured
 in blocks. I.e. files can be certainly any numbers of byte, but all utils will
 look  on  blocks  (by  the way from here the basic problem of reduction of the
 size excutable file about what will be lower).

 From  all  formats  of  files,  us more interest executable formats which as I
 spoke above 4 kinds:

  executable - it is direct and it is executed. 
  shareable  - it is caused or from others shareable, or from executable, i.e.
               by 'unix words' - shared object file. 
  protected  - uwss (user_written system services). The same most shareable, 
               only with the mechanism permission. It is executed in space of 
               a kernel.
  system     - are used by a kernel and it is direct cpu. I.e. it is simple
               pieces of a code not intended for performance under an OS. Have
               no headers (though nevertheless it is possible to put) and the
               table of global symbols.

 So  it  has  turned out, that not compaq, not earlier dec, not someone another
 does  not  publish  structure  executable  files. Than it is caused I not in a
 rate, but it is possible on that is the objective reasons. As though there was
 not,  a  little  having  rummaged  I  have  found  out everything, that it was
 necessary for me:

 Standard  executable file received at 'link file' (speech about VAX, not about
 alpha) has folowing structure:


 1. header - 48 bytes. 
 2. activation information - 20 bytes.
 3. GST/DST - 28 bytes. 
 4. identification information - 80 bytes.
 5. Section headers - uncertain numbers. The ending of headers is fixed on
    ffffh. Usually it is 3-4 headers (not all of section undertake from a file). 
 6. The first section - section of a machine code.
 7. The second section - 'activator fixup' section. 
 8. The third section - some information on modules, labels and etc.


 From  all  this stuff on the present it is important a little: header, a piece
 of  the  information  of activation, 3 header sections and a code. I.e. all of
 section  (except  for  a  code;)  without  serious  consequences  (taking into
 account,  that  we  we  we  write  without use of libraries) it is possible to
 remove,  but  for  this  purpose it is necessary to know where and as these of
 section  settle  down;)  For  the beginning we shall consider the fixed header
 from image header (48 bytes) and structure of header sections:

 After  cutting  about  what I have told above, we receive 512 obligatory bytes
 under  the first block (since the code can be not lower 512), and further only
 machine  code.  Basically  it  is  possible to do jmp in the first block image
 header  where  at us practically 70% can be used (on dump it 'a' symbols), but
 it  will  be  problematic.  At  attempt jmp earlier than for 512 bytes without
 additional  headers (which address to section on-block, that too a problem) we
 shall  receive  the  appropriate  mistakes.  Problem this (the organization of
 file-structure  more;) it is already necessary to bypass at a system level for
 what  the maximal privileges are necessary certainly. In any case - we receive
 always  the  first  block necessarily, and further exactly so much how many we
 shall write (and looking as we shall write).

 Speech  has touched times debugger, that time to talk about the assembler. The
 assembler  used by default in openvms is called 'macro'. macro32 and macro64 -
 versions  under vax and alpha accordingly. This article is focused on vax CPU,
 therefore  the  question  will  be about appropriate asm. The processor has 16
 registers:
 
 from r1 up to r11  - general registers
 r12 ot AP          - argv pointer. if uses as general register, it is better
                      to use r12,if as pointer,it is better to use AP
 FP                 - frame pointer
 SP	            - stack pointer
 PC                 - program pointer
 
 Banal print with use libs will look so:
 
 ; $ macro test.s
 ; $ link test.obj
 ; $ run test

 .entry start , ^m<>                    ; entry point wichout save registers
         pushaq  s1                     
         calls   #1, g^lib$put_output   ; call
         ret
 s1:     .ascid  /x25zine#3/
 .end start


 To  explain  here  there  is  nothing unless to tell, that lib$put_output uses
 further  decc$dprintf.  print it of course very cool, but opportunities of jmp
 in  kenrel  and  other  are  more  interesting. The most simple way of jump tu
 kernel (of course need cmkrnl priv.):

 .entry i_want_to_kernel,^m<>           
        $cmkrnl_s -                 ; switch to kernel mode.
               routin=super_code    ; our super code
        ret                         ; exit

 ; below code already executable in kernel space.

 .entry super_code,^m<>

        movl #1,r1 
        movl #1,r2                  ; super code ;)
        movl #1,r3
        ret 
        $exit_s

 .end i_want_to_kernel


 Basically  and  all.  On ending only I shall tell one funny the moment: system
 clocks  in  openvms  tick from November, 17, 1858. Not difficult calculations,
 knowing  modified julian day and other, it turns out, that clocks will walk to
 July 31, 31086 year ;)
